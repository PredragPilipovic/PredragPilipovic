# Predrag Pilipovic's Personal Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal website, hosted at [https://predragpilipovic.github.io](https://predragpilipovic.github.io). This site serves as a platform to showcase my research, publications, and professional journey.

## About Me

I am a postdoctoral researcher in mathematical statistics at the University of Copenhagen. My academic background includes:

- **PhD in Mathematical Statistics**: Dual degree from the University of Copenhagen and Bielefeld University.
- **MSc in Applied Mathematics**: University of Grenoble Alpes.
- **MSc in Mathematical Statistics**: University of Belgrade.
- **BSc in Mathematics**: University of Belgrade.

My research interests encompass statistical methods for stochastic processes, particularly stochastic differential equations (SDEs), as well as statistical inference, optimization techniques, and their applications in various fields, including ecology. I am also passionate about teaching and mentoring students in statistics.
